## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Burying the CTA** - Include CTAs throughout, not just at bottom
2. **Keyword stuffing** - Write naturally, cover topic comprehensively
3. **Stock photos on About page** - Use real photos only
4. **Generic "Why Us"** - Be specific and provable
5. **Service siloing gone wrong** - Don't create thin pages for minor variations
6. **Mixing legal practice areas** - Keep PI separate from Family Law
7. **Medical jargon** - Use patient-friendly terms in headings
