# The Service Page: The Money Page

Service Pages are the **primary engine for both rankings and conversions**. Unlike the Home Page, which routes traffic, Service Pages must close the deal.

<Callout type="insight">
A well-optimized Service Page can rank for dozens of related queries. A page targeting "emergency plumber in Dallas" might also rank for "24 hour plumber Dallas," "burst pipe repair Dallas," and "plumber near me" for Dallas-area users.
</Callout>

## Content Priority (Top to Bottom)

### 1. Descriptive H1

The H1 should be specific and include intent modifiers when appropriate.

<ComparisonTable
  headers={["Weak H1", "Strong H1"]}
  rows={[
    ["Plumbing Services", "Emergency Plumbing Services in Dallas - Available 24/7"],
    ["Our Legal Team", "Dallas Personal Injury Lawyers | Free Consultation"],
    ["Medical Services", "Knee Replacement Surgery in Houston"]
  ]}
/>

### 2. The Hook (Problem/Solution)

Open by acknowledging the user's pain point, then immediately offer your solution. This creates an emotional connection.

<SampleContent vertical="home-services">
"A burst pipe at 2 AM is every homeowner's nightmare. Water damage compounds by the minute, and panic sets in fast. **ABC Plumbing's emergency team responds within 60 minutes, 24/7, 365 days a year.** We stop the damage and restore your peace of mind."
</SampleContent>

<SampleContent vertical="legal">
"When a negligent driver turns your life upside down, you need more than a lawyer—you need a fighter. **Johnson Law Firm has recovered over $50 million for car accident victims across Dallas-Fort Worth.**"
</SampleContent>

<SampleContent vertical="medical">
"Chronic knee pain shouldn't control your life. If arthritis, injury, or wear-and-tear has made everyday activities painful, **total knee replacement may offer lasting relief**. Our fellowship-trained surgeons have performed over 3,000 successful procedures."
</SampleContent>

### 3. The Trust Trigger

Immediately follow the hook with credibility signals specific to this service:
- Years of experience in this specialty
- Relevant certifications
- Number of successful jobs
- Notable case results (for legal)

### 4. Process/What to Expect

A step-by-step breakdown reduces anxiety by eliminating unknowns:

1. **Call or Book Online:** Reach us 24/7. Describe your issue briefly.
2. **Rapid Dispatch:** A licensed technician is dispatched within 15 minutes.
3. **On-Site Assessment:** We diagnose the problem and provide upfront pricing.
4. **Expert Service:** We fix the issue using professional-grade materials.
5. **Final Walkthrough:** We show you what was done and answer questions.

### 5. FAQs (Schema Optimized)

Answer the "People Also Ask" questions found in SERPs. Structure as H3 questions with direct answers.

<Callout type="tip">
Implement FAQ schema markup for potential rich result display. Use the exact question phrasing from PAA.
</Callout>

### 6. Social Proof

Reviews specifically about **this service**, not generic company reviews. If you're writing a plumbing emergency page, show reviews from customers who had plumbing emergencies.

## Content Length Guidance

**Quality always trumps word count**, but competitive terms typically require sufficient depth:

| Competition Level | Word Count Range |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Low competition | 500-800 words |
| Moderate competition | 800-1,200 words |
| High competition | 1,200-2,000+ words |

<Callout type="warning">
The goal is not to hit a word count but to comprehensively address the topic while maintaining engagement.
</Callout>

## Mobile-Specific Requirements

<InteractiveChecklist id="service-page-mobile">
- [ ] CTA buttons after every distinct section
- [ ] Sticky "Schedule Now" or "Call Now" button
- [ ] Paragraphs no more than 3 lines on mobile viewport
- [ ] Buttons pass the "thumb test" (easily tappable)
- [ ] Click-to-call phone numbers, not text-only
</InteractiveChecklist>

## Service Page Do's and Don'ts

<ComparisonTable
  headers={["Do", "Don't"]}
  rows={[
    ["Lead with the user's problem and your solution", "Start with company history or generic welcome text"],
    ["Include CTAs after every major section", "Place only one CTA at the very bottom"],
    ["Use service-specific testimonials", "Use generic company-wide reviews"],
    ["Answer PAA questions with clear, direct responses", "Bury answers in walls of text"],
    ["Include process steps to reduce uncertainty", "Assume users know what to expect"]
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="mistake" title="Service Siloing Gone Wrong">
While separating services into distinct pages is correct, some teams create too many thin pages for minor service variations. "Ant Control" and "Ant Removal" don't need separate pages. Group closely related services and use H2/H3 subheadings to address variations within a single, comprehensive page.
