# The Home Page: The Hub

The Home Page serves as the **traffic controller** for your website. Its primary job is not to convert visitors directly but to validate that they're in the right place and route them efficiently to the specific Service Page that matches their need.

<Callout type="insight">
Think of the Home Page like an airport terminal. Travelers (users) arrive with different destinations (needs). Your job is to show them clear signage (navigation and service buckets) so they can quickly find their gate (Service Page).
</Callout>

**Key insight:** Home Pages rarely rank for specific service terms. A user searching for "emergency plumber" will almost always land on a Service Page, not the Home Page. The Home Page typically ranks for branded searches and broad geographic terms.

## Content Priority (Top to Bottom)

### 1. Hero Section

The hero section must answer **three questions within 3 seconds**:
- What do you do?
- Where do you do it?
- How do I take action?

**Required Elements:**
- **H1:** Broad seed keyword + geographic modifier
- **Subheadline:** Brief value proposition or key differentiator
- **CTA Button:** High-contrast, action-oriented ("Get a Free Quote" not "Learn More")
- **Phone Number:** Click-to-call on mobile, prominently displayed

### 2. Trust Bar

Immediately below the hero, display quick trust signals:
- Aggregate review rating ("4.9 stars on 500+ reviews")
- Accreditation logos
- "As Seen On" media logos
- Years in business

<Callout type="tip">
This strip should be scannable in under 2 seconds.
</Callout>

### 3. Service Bucket Links

A visual grid of **3-6 top services**, each linking to its respective Service Page. Use icons or small images to aid visual scanning. This is the routing mechanism.

### 4. The "Why Us" Snapshot

<ComparisonTable
  headers={["Weak \"Why Us\"", "Strong \"Why Us\""]}
  rows={[
    ["Quality service you can trust", "Same-day service guaranteed or it's free"],
    ["Experienced professionals", "Licensed technicians with 15+ years average experience"],
    ["Affordable prices", "Upfront pricing with no hidden fees"]
  ]}
/>

### 5. Service Area Map/List

Visual confirmation of where the business operates:
- Embedded Google Map with service area highlighted, OR
- Simple list of cities/neighborhoods served

This reinforces local relevance.

### 6. Testimonials

Two to three short, believable reviews. Include first name, last initial, and city for credibility. Avoid walls of text—pull the most impactful quote.

### 7. Final CTA

A closing call-to-action section with a clear prompt ("Ready to get started?") and another high-contrast button or form.

<Callout type="tip" title="The Three-Second Test">
Show your Home Page to someone unfamiliar with the business for exactly three seconds, then close it. Ask them: What does this company do? Where do they operate? How would you contact them? If they can't answer all three, your hero section needs work.
