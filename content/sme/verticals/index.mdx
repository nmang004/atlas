# Vertical Deep Dives

Every industry has unique search behaviors, user psychology, and compliance requirements. These deep dives provide the specialized knowledge you need to create effective content for each vertical.

## Our Core Verticals

<Callout type="insight">
Each vertical guide covers user psychology, tone guidelines, compliance requirements, and sample content blocks. Start with the overview below, then dive into the specific vertical you're working on.
</Callout>

### Home Services

**HVAC, Plumbing, Pest Control, Landscaping**

Home services users split into two distinct mindsets: **emergency** (crisis mode, need help now) and **maintenance** (planning ahead, comparing options). Content must address both while prioritizing emergency messaging for high-intent traffic.

**Key characteristics:**
- Speed and availability are primary differentiators
- Visual trust signals (branded trucks, uniformed technicians) are critical
- Upfront pricing messaging reduces conversion friction
- Before/after photos drive landscaping conversions

### Medical

**Specialists, Private Practice, Med Spa, Urgent Care**

Medical searchers are often anxious and conducting significant research. This is **YMYL (Your Money Your Life)** territory requiring maximum E-E-A-T signals. Compliance requirements (HIPAA, testimonial regulations) add complexity.

**Key characteristics:**
- Symptom-first searching requires funnel-based content strategy
- Physician credentials must be prominent and verifiable
- Insurance and cost anxiety are major conversion barriers
- Elective vs. necessity care require different tone approaches

### Legal

**Personal Injury, Family Law, Immigration, Criminal Defense**

Legal searchers are often in crisis, experiencing high stress and low trust. They seek a **"champion"**: someone who will fight for them through an unfamiliar, intimidating process. Tone varies significantly by practice area.

**Key characteristics:**
- Question-based searching creates featured snippet opportunities
- Outcome focus (settlement amounts, charges dismissed) builds trust
- Geographic specificity is essential (jurisdiction-specific content)
- Practice areas must be siloed—never cross-pollinate unrelated services

## Cross-Vertical Principles

While each vertical has unique requirements, these principles apply across all industries:

<ComparisonTable
  headers={["Principle", "Application"]}
  rows={[
    ["Time to Value", "Lead with the answer. User intent must be satisfied above the fold."],
    ["E-E-A-T", "Every vertical needs demonstrated expertise, but the signals differ (credentials for medical, results for legal, certifications for home services)."],
    ["Local Focus", "All three verticals are inherently local. Geographic modifiers and location pages are essential."],
    ["Mobile First", "Emergency searches (burst pipe, car accident, chest pain) happen on mobile. Ensure instant load times and prominent CTAs."]
