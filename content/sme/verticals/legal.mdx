# Legal Vertical Deep Dive

Legal searchers are often in crisis, experiencing high stress and low trust. They're seeking a **"champion"**: someone who will fight for them and guide them through an unfamiliar, intimidating process.

## User Psychology & Search Behavior

Key behavioral patterns:

| Pattern | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| **Question-based searching** | "What is the statute of limitations for personal injury in Texas?" |
| **Outcome focus** | For PI, users want settlement amounts. For criminal, they want to know consequences. |
| **Cost sensitivity** | "Free consultation" is often a deciding factor |
| **Geo-specificity** | Legal issues are jurisdiction-specific; users search with location modifiers |

## Tone & Voice Guidelines

Legal tone **varies significantly by practice area**. Match the tone to the emotional state of the user:

| Practice Area | Tone | Key Words |
|---------------|------|-----------|
| **Personal Injury** | Aggressive, protective, results-focused | Fight, protect, win, recover, compensation, justice |
| **Criminal Defense** | Protective, urgent, experienced | Defend, protect rights, challenge evidence, experience |
| **Family Law** | Compassionate, guiding, stabilizing | Guide, mediate, protect your future, best interests |
| **Immigration** | Hopeful, knowledgeable, supportive | Navigate, pathway, advocate, reunite, opportunity |

    ["Experienced, seasoned, veteran", "New, learning, junior"],
    ["Protect your rights, defend your future", "Maybe, might, hope"]

## Critical Content Elements

### Zero-Click Answer Strategy

Legal content has high potential for AI Overviews and featured snippets because users ask specific questions.

**Example:**

**H2: What is the statute of limitations for personal injury in Texas?**

"In Texas, you generally have **two years** from the date of injury to file a personal injury lawsuit. However, specific circumstances can affect this deadline..."

<Callout type="tip">
Structure content to directly answer PAA questions with the answer in the first sentence. This format is most likely to be pulled into featured snippets.
</Callout>

### Results and Case Studies

| Practice Area | Trust Signal Focus |
|---------------|-------------------|
| **Personal Injury** | Settlement amounts and verdicts (with disclaimers) |
| **Family Law** | Qualitative outcomes: families helped, custody arrangements |
| **Criminal Defense** | Cases dismissed, charges reduced |
| **Immigration** | Visas approved, families reunited |

### Required Disclaimers

<Callout type="warning">
Every legal page must include appropriate disclaimers:
- "Past results do not guarantee future outcomes"
- "This is not legal advice"
- State bar advertising compliance statements
- Consult with the client's compliance team
</Callout>

## Geographic Modifier Strategy

Legal keywords require geographic specificity. "Divorce lawyer" is too broad; "Divorce lawyer in Harris County, Texas" is the actual target.

**Structure pages around specific jurisdictions** and include local court information where relevant.

## Service Line Separation

<Callout type="mistake" title="Mixing Practice Areas">
Legal clients sometimes want to bundle unrelated practice areas (PI and Family Law). **Resist this.** Separate these completely into distinct silos. Cross-pollinating unrelated practice areas dilutes topical authority and confuses users. A user in a car accident doesn't need to see divorce content.

## Sample Content Block: Personal Injury Service Page

**H1: Dallas Car Accident Lawyer - Fighting for Maximum Compensation**

<SampleContent vertical="legal">
"When a negligent driver turns your life upside down, you need more than a lawyer—you need a fighter. At Johnson Law Firm, we've recovered over $50 million for car accident victims across Dallas-Fort Worth, including a $2.3 million verdict against a commercial trucking company.

Insurance companies have teams of lawyers working to minimize your payout. You deserve the same firepower on your side. We handle every aspect of your claim—investigating the accident, negotiating with insurers, and taking your case to trial if necessary—while you focus on recovery. Free consultation, no fee unless we win."
</SampleContent>

<Callout type="tip" title='The "Champion" Framework'>
Legal users are looking for someone to fight for them. Frame the attorney as the user's champion against powerful opposing forces (insurance companies, prosecutors, the other spouse's attorney). Use "we" to create partnership: "We will fight for you" rather than "The firm provides representation."
