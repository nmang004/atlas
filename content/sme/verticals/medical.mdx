# Medical Vertical Deep Dive

Medical searchers are often anxious and conducting significant research before taking action. This is classic **YMYL (Your Money Your Life)** territory, where the stakes are high and users need authoritative, trustworthy information.

## User Psychology & Search Behavior

Key behavioral patterns:

| Pattern | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| **Symptom-first searching** | Users often search symptoms ("why does my heel hurt") before treatments ("plantar fasciitis treatment") |
| **Credential verification** | Users actively look up doctors' credentials and reviews before booking |
| **Insurance/cost anxiety** | "Do they accept my insurance?" is often the deciding factor |
| **Location sensitivity** | Users prefer providers close to home or work |

## Tone & Voice Guidelines

Medical content requires a careful balance: **professional authority + genuine empathy**. Users need to feel confident in the provider's expertise while also feeling they'll be treated with compassion.

## Critical Content Elements

### Compliance Requirements

<Callout type="warning" title="Medical Compliance">
All medical content must adhere to strict compliance requirements:
</Callout>

<InteractiveChecklist id="medical-compliance">
- [ ] **HIPAA:** All forms must be HIPAA compliant. Never collect detailed medical history through non-secure forms.
- [ ] **No "cure" claims:** Use "treatment" or "management" instead. Never guarantee medical outcomes.
- [ ] **Before/after photos:** For cosmetic procedures, ensure proper patient consent and realistic representation.
- [ ] **Testimonials:** Check state regulations—some states restrict or prohibit patient testimonials.
</InteractiveChecklist>

### Bio Optimization

The physician's credentials must be **prominent and above the fold**.

**Required elements:**
- Board Certifications
- Fellowship training
- Medical school
- Hospital affiliations
- Years of specialized experience
- Professional memberships
- Link to external verification (state medical board, hospital profiles)

## Content Strategy: Symptoms to Treatments

Build a content funnel that captures users at different stages:

| Funnel Stage | Content Type | Example |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| **Top (Blog)** | Symptom-focused content | "Why does my heel hurt in the morning?" |
| **Middle (Condition)** | Condition explanations | "What is Plantar Fasciitis?" |
| **Bottom (Service)** | Treatment-focused | "Plantar Fasciitis Treatment in Houston" |

<Callout type="tip">
Internal linking should guide users down the funnel. A blog post on heel pain symptoms → plantar fasciitis condition page → treatment service page.
</Callout>

## Sub-Vertical Nuances

### Elective Procedures (Plastic Surgery, Med Spa)

- Focus on **results and financing**
- These users are often self-pay, so payment plans matter
- Galleries of results are primary conversion drivers
- Tone can be more aspirational

### Necessity Care (Urgent Care, Orthopedics, Primary Care)

- Focus on **access**: wait times, insurance accepted, location convenience, hours
- Speed of appointment availability is often the deciding factor

## Sample Content Block: Orthopedic Service Page

**H1: Knee Replacement Surgery in Houston**

<SampleContent vertical="medical">
"Chronic knee pain shouldn't control your life. If arthritis, injury, or wear-and-tear has made everyday activities painful, total knee replacement may offer lasting relief. At Houston Orthopedic Specialists, our fellowship-trained joint replacement surgeons have performed over 3,000 successful knee replacements using the latest minimally invasive techniques.

We understand that deciding on surgery is significant. Our patient-centered approach includes a thorough evaluation of all options, clear explanation of what to expect, and a personalized recovery plan. Most patients return to normal activities within 6-12 weeks."
</SampleContent>

<Callout type="mistake" title="Medical Jargon Overload">
It's tempting to use clinical terminology to demonstrate expertise, but patients search using everyday language. They search "knee replacement" not "total knee arthroplasty." Use patient-friendly terms in headings and primary content, with clinical terms included for completeness.
