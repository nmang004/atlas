# E-E-A-T: Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness

E-E-A-T is Google's framework for evaluating content quality, particularly for "Your Money or Your Life" (YMYL) topics like health, finance, and legal matters.

<Callout type="insight">
Understanding E-E-A-T is critical because it directly influences how Google ranks content in sensitive categories—which includes all three of our verticals.
</Callout>

## Experience (The Newest Addition)

Google added "Experience" to the original E-A-T framework in December 2022. This signals that **first-hand experience with a topic matters**.

Content from someone who has actually performed a service, used a product, or lived through an experience is valued more highly than content from someone who has only researched it.

### How to Demonstrate Experience

- Include **specific case studies** with real outcomes
- Show **before/after photos** of actual work performed
- Reference **specific client situations** (with permission) rather than hypotheticals
- Use language that reflects hands-on knowledge: "In our experience..." "We typically see..."

## Expertise

Expertise refers to the **depth of knowledge** demonstrated in the content. For medical and legal content, this often requires credentials. For home services, it means demonstrating technical competence and industry knowledge.

### How to Demonstrate Expertise

    ["Generic descriptions anyone could write", "Detailed, technically accurate explanations"],
    ["No credentials mentioned", "Certifications, licenses, memberships displayed"],
    ["Surface-level content", "In-depth coverage beyond competitors"],
    ["No author attribution", "Author bios with credentials linked to profiles"]

## Authoritativeness

Authoritativeness is about **reputation within your field**. It's built through mentions from other authoritative sources, quality backlinks, and recognition by industry peers.

### How to Demonstrate Authoritativeness

- **"As Seen On"** sections featuring media mentions or industry publications
- **Awards and recognition** from industry bodies
- **Partnerships** with recognized brands (manufacturer partnerships for HVAC, bar association memberships for legal)
- **Quality backlinks** from relevant industry sources

## Trustworthiness

Trustworthiness is the **foundation** that the other three elements build upon. A site can have expertise and authority, but if users don't trust it, conversions won't happen.

### How to Demonstrate Trustworthiness

<InteractiveChecklist id="trust-signals">
- [ ] Display real customer reviews with full names and photos

## E-E-A-T Varies by Vertical

<Callout type="tip">
The weight of each E-E-A-T component varies by industry. Tailor your approach accordingly.
</Callout>

| Vertical | Primary Focus | Secondary Focus |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Medical** | Expertise (credentials) | Trust (patient reviews, HIPAA compliance) |
| **Legal** | Expertise (credentials) + Authority (case results) | Trust (transparent fees, bar standing) |
| **Home Services** | Experience (project examples) | Trust (reviews, guarantees, licensing) |
