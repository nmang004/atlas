# The Shift: From Keywords to Answers

Traditional SEO focused on identifying target keywords and placing them strategically throughout a page. While keywords still matter, the game has fundamentally changed.

<Callout type="insight">
Modern SEO is about understanding and satisfying **search intent**, then structuring content so that both humans and AI can extract clear answers.
</Callout>

## Understanding Search Intent

Every search query has an underlying intent. Recognizing and matching that intent is more important than keyword density.

| Intent Type | Example Query | What User Wants | Content Approach |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Informational** | "How does pest control work" | Education, understanding | Detailed explanations, process breakdowns |
| **Navigational** | "ABC Plumbing phone number" | Specific business info | Clear NAP, easy contact access |
| **Transactional** | "Emergency plumber near me" | Immediate service | Fast-loading, prominent CTAs, phone number |
| **Commercial Investigation** | "Best HVAC company in Dallas" | Comparison, validation | Reviews, credentials, differentiators |

## The Question-Answer Format

To optimize for AI Overviews and featured snippets, structure content around questions and direct answers.

<Callout type="tip">
Use H2 and H3 headings as questions, then answer immediately in the first sentence of the following paragraph.
</Callout>

<ComparisonTable
  headers={["Weak Structure", "Strong Structure"]}
  rows={[
    ["H2: Pest Control Costs", "H2: How Much Does Pest Control Cost in Dallas?"],
    ["\"Many factors affect pest control pricing. First, consider the size of your home...\"", "\"Pest control in Dallas typically costs $150-$300 for a one-time treatment or $40-$70 per month for ongoing service. Here's what affects your specific price...\""]
  ]}
/>

### Why Strong Structure Wins

The strong structure:
- **Leads with the direct answer** in the first sentence
- **Is more likely to be pulled into AI Overviews** and featured snippets
- **Provides immediate value** to users
- **Signals topic relevance** to search engines

## Avoiding Keyword Stuffing

<Callout type="mistake" title="Keyword Stuffing in the AI Era">
Some teams still try to cram target keywords into every sentence. This approach backfires. Modern algorithms penalize unnatural language and reward content that reads naturally while comprehensively covering a topic.
</Callout>

### Natural vs. Stuffed Content

<ComparisonTable
  headers={["Keyword Stuffed (Bad)", "Natural Language (Good)"]}
  rows={[
    ["\"Our Dallas plumber services include Dallas emergency plumbing, Dallas drain cleaning, and Dallas water heater repair by our Dallas plumbers.\"", "\"We offer comprehensive plumbing services throughout Dallas, including emergency repairs, drain cleaning, and water heater installation. Our licensed technicians respond within 60 minutes.\""],
    ["Unreadable, penalized", "Natural, ranks well"]
  ]}
/>

## Structuring for AI Extraction

When Google's AI generates overviews, it extracts information from pages that:

1. **Answer questions directly** in the first sentence after the heading
2. **Use clear, factual language** that AI can confidently extract
3. **Include specific data** (numbers, prices, timeframes)
4. **Match "People Also Ask"** questions exactly

### Research PAA for Your Keywords

Before writing any page:

<InteractiveChecklist id="paa-research">
- [ ] Search your target keyword in Google
- [ ] Note all "People Also Ask" questions that appear
- [ ] Structure your content to answer each PAA question
- [ ] Use the exact question phrasing in your H2/H3 headings
- [ ] Answer directly in the first sentence after each heading
</InteractiveChecklist>

<Callout type="tip">
The question-answer format works because it mirrors how people actually search AND how AI systems extract information. It's a win for both humans and algorithms.
