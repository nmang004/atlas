# Time to Value & Conversion Velocity

These two metrics are the foundation of everything we do. Understanding and optimizing for them will dramatically improve both rankings and conversions.

## Understanding Time to Value

**Time to Value (TTV)** measures how quickly a visitor can accomplish their goal after landing on a page. In SEO content, this typically means:

- Finding the answer to their question
- Confirming they are in the right place
- Taking the next step toward conversion

<Callout type="insight">
Modern users have extremely short attention spans. Research shows users form opinions about a website within 50 milliseconds and will abandon a page if they cannot find what they need within 10-15 seconds.
</Callout>

### How to Optimize for TTV

**Lead with the answer.** If someone searches for "how much does pest control cost," the first thing they should see is a price range or pricing structure. Supporting details come after.

<ComparisonTable
  headers={["Low TTV (Avoid)", "High TTV (Best Practice)"]}
  rows={[
    ["\"Welcome to ABC Pest Control! We've been serving families since 1985...\"", "\"Pest control in Dallas typically costs $150-$300 for a one-time treatment. Here's what affects your price...\""],
    ["Long company history before addressing the user's question", "Direct answer followed by supporting context"],
    ["Requires scrolling to find relevant information", "Key information visible above the fold"]
  ]}
/>

## Understanding Conversion Velocity

**Conversion Velocity** measures how quickly and easily a visitor can move from interest to action. This isn't just about having a contact form—it's about removing every possible friction point.

<Callout type="warning">
Every additional click, scroll, or moment of confusion represents potential drop-off. In competitive markets, the business that makes it easiest to get in touch wins.
</Callout>

### Elements That Increase Conversion Velocity

1. **Sticky headers** with click-to-call buttons on mobile
2. **CTA buttons** after every major content section (not just at the bottom)
3. **Short, single-column forms** (name, phone, brief description)
4. **Clear next steps** ("We'll call you within 15 minutes")
5. **Multiple contact options** (phone, form, chat)

<Callout type="mistake" title="Burying the CTA">
A frequent error is placing the only call-to-action at the very bottom of a long page. Users who are convinced early shouldn't have to scroll past content they don't need. Include CTAs after the hero section, after the "Why Us" section, and at the bottom.
</Callout>

## The Connection Between TTV and Conversion Velocity

These metrics work together:

- **High TTV + High Conversion Velocity** = Users quickly find what they need AND can easily take action
- **High TTV + Low Conversion Velocity** = Users find answers but struggle to convert (friction)
- **Low TTV + High Conversion Velocity** = Users can easily contact but may not be convinced (confusion)
- **Low TTV + Low Conversion Velocity** = Users leave frustrated (failure)

<Callout type="tip">
Always ask yourself two questions when reviewing a page: "Can a visitor get their answer in under 10 seconds?" and "Can they contact the business in under 3 clicks?"
</Callout>
