# Welcome to the SME Knowledge Base

This handbook is your definitive reference guide for creating high-quality SEO content across our three core verticals: **Home Services**, **Medical**, and **Legal**.

## The Answer Engine Philosophy

Search has fundamentally changed. In 2025, we are no longer optimizing for **search engines** alone. We are optimizing for **Answer Engines**: AI Overviews, voice assistants, zero-click results, and featured snippets that deliver answers directly to users without requiring a click.

<Callout type="insight">
Every page we create must satisfy the user's intent *immediately* at the top of the page while providing enough depth and authority signals to convince both humans and algorithms that we are the definitive source on the topic.

## Our Two Guiding Metrics

| Metric | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| **Time to Value** | How quickly can a visitor find what they need? If they have to scroll or hunt, we have failed. |
| **Conversion Velocity** | How frictionless is the path from landing to contact? Every unnecessary click is a potential lost lead. |
