# On-Page Elements Specification

Use this as your reference checklist for every page you create or audit.

## Title Tags

**Format:** Primary Keyword + Geo + Brand

**Character Limit:** Maximum 60 characters (to avoid truncation in SERPs)

<Callout type="insight">
Put the primary keyword **FIRST**. Google gives more weight to early words.
</Callout>

<ComparisonTable
  headers={["Weak Title", "Strong Title"]}
  rows={[
    ["ABC Plumbing - Services", "Emergency Plumber Dallas | ABC Plumbing"],
    ["Welcome to Smith Law Firm", "Dallas Personal Injury Lawyer | Smith Law"],
    ["Our HVAC Services in the DFW Area", "HVAC Repair Dallas | 24/7 Service | ABC HVAC"]
  ]}
/>

**Why the strong examples work:**
- Keyword appears first
- Geographic modifier included
- Under 60 characters
- Brand at the end

## Meta Descriptions

**Character Limit:** Maximum 155 characters

**Required Elements:**
- Value proposition
- Call to action
- Phone number (where appropriate)

<Callout type="tip">
Meta descriptions don't directly impact rankings but significantly affect click-through rates. Write them as ad copy.
</Callout>

<ComparisonTable
  headers={["Weak Meta Description", "Strong Meta Description"]}
  rows={[
    ["ABC Plumbing offers plumbing services in Dallas. Contact us for more information about our services.", "24/7 emergency plumber in Dallas. Same-day service, upfront pricing. Call (555) 123-4567 for a free estimate today."],
    ["Smith Law Firm handles personal injury cases.", "Injured in Dallas? Get the compensation you deserve. Free consultation, no fee unless we win. Call (555) 234-5678."]
  ]}
/>

## H1 Tags

**Rules:**
- **One H1 per page, no exceptions**
- Must contain the core target keyword
- Be descriptive and specific

<ComparisonTable
  headers={["Avoid", "Use"]}
  rows={[
    ["Welcome to [Company]", "Emergency Plumbing Services in Dallas"],
    ["Our Services", "24/7 HVAC Repair in Fort Worth"],
    ["Home", "Board-Certified Orthopedic Care in Houston"]
  ]}
/>

## URL Structure

**Format:** `domain.com/service/keyword-geo`

**Rules:**
- Lowercase only
- Hyphens between words (not underscores)
- No dates
- No unnecessary parameters

<ComparisonTable
  headers={["Weak URL", "Strong URL"]}
  rows={[
    ["domain.com/services.php?id=123", "domain.com/services/emergency-plumber-dallas"],
    ["domain.com/Blog/2024/01/pest_control_tips", "domain.com/blog/pest-control-tips"],
    ["domain.com/page-1", "domain.com/hvac-repair"]
  ]}
/>
